This GitHub repository contains files and programs needed to create a heightmap in the  Unreal game engine.
I created an ArcMap shapefile from the CSV file that has lat, long, elevation, and slope data (fy20_adc_data_file_88_degrees.csv)
Students can load this file either to QGIS or ArcMap and select a small number of points (subset) that they want the bring into the Unreal engine if they cannot handle the data points in the complete CSV file.
The shared link for the Esri shapefile is given below:
