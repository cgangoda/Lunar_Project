This github repository contain files and programs that are needed to create a height map in unreal game engine
I created a ArcMap shape file from the CSV file that has lat, long, elevation, and slope data (fy20_adc_data_file_88_degrees.csv)
Students can load this file either to QGIS or ArcMap and select a small number of points (subset) that they want the bring into unreal engine if they cannot handle the data points in the complete CSV file.
The shared link for the esri shape file is given below:
